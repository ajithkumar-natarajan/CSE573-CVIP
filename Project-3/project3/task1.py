K-Means Segmentation Problem
(Due date: Nov. 25, 11:59 P.M., 2019)
The goal of this task is to segment image using k-means clustering.

Do NOT modify the code provided to you.
Do NOT import ANY library or API besides what has been listed.
Hint: 
Please complete all the functions that are labeled with '#to do'. 
You are allowed to add your own functions if needed.
You should design you algorithm as fast as possible. To avoid repetitve calculation, you are suggested to depict clustering based on statistic histogram [0,255]. 
You will be graded based on the total distortion, e.g., sum of distances, the less the better your clustering is.
